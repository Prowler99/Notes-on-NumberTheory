\section{Introduction}
Here goes some text that you can replace with yours. But in what follows a couple of hints, should you need them, are provided.

This Overlaf project contains, a part from two classes (file ending with \texttt{.cls}) , two packages (file ending with \texttt{.sty}) and two bibliographical styles (file ending with \texttt{.bst}), also two .tex files (one in English, one in French) which contain very useful information. Below we describe some parts of it, but you are encouraged to read them anyhow.

\subsection{About the numbering}
By default, theorems and theorem-like statements are numbered according to the section in which they appear:
\begin{theo} You see what I mean.
\end{theo}
Some theoremlike environments are defined. They use one and the same counter.
\par\nobreak
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\noalign{\hrule height .08em\vskip.65ex}
Style & {\tt Macro} \LaTeX & Nom fran\c{c}ais & English name\quad \\
\noalign{\vskip .4ex \hrule height 0.05em\vskip.65ex}
\it plain & \tt theo & Th\'eor\`eme & \it Theorem \\
 & \tt prop & Proposition & \it Proposition \\
 & \tt conj & Conjecture & \it Conjecture \\
 & \tt coro & Corollaire & \it Corollary \\
 & \tt lemm & Lemme & \it Lemma \\
\noalign{\vskip .4ex \hrule height 0.05em\vskip.65ex}
\it definition & \tt defi & D\'efinition & \it Definition \\
\noalign{\vskip .4ex \hrule height 0.05em\vskip.65ex}
\it remark & \tt rema & Remarque & \it Remark \\
 & \tt exem & Exemple & \it Example \\
\noalign{\vskip .4ex \hrule height 0.08em\vskip.65ex}
\end{tabular}\end{center}
The way of numbering the statements is described in detail in the \texttt{$\ast$-doc.tex} file.

\subsubsection{Generic statement}

This is a \verb|\subsubsection|, and you see the difference. 
\begin{enonce}{Question}
Do you see the difference?
\end{enonce}
The above nice statement ``which looks like a Theorem although is a Question'' can be introduced by using \texttt{enonce}: look in the code to see the example, and in the \texttt{$\ast$-doc.tex} file for more details.

\section{And now: the bibliography!}
We have been very happy to read \cite{GMP81} as well as \cite[Theorem~2.5]{BMM94} or possibly the series of two papers \cite{GS,GS82}.

\bibliography{bibtemplate}%This it the name of the file where you put all your entries
\bibliographystyle{smfalpha} %This is the style of your bibliography: you choose it among smfalpha, smfplain or—if publishing for the Revue d'Histoire des Mathématiques—rhmunsrtnat. When changing styles, you might get some errors by the server: select "recompile from scratch" a couple of times before getting mad.
