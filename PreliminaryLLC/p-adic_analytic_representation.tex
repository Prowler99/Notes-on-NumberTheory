\section{Locally Analytic Groups}
Let $L$ be a $p$-adic field, and $K/L$ an extension with valuation extended.

An $L$\textbf{-locally analytic group} (of dimension $d$?) is a topological group $G$ such that:\begin{itemize}
    \item it is a \textbf{locally $L$-analytic manifold} admits an atlas consists of charts
    $G\supset U\to K^d$ where the transition maps given by locally analytic functions (i.e. locally given by power series over $L$); and
    \item the multiplication is locally analytic.
\end{itemize}

A vector space $V$ over a topological field $K$ is called \textbf{locally convex},
if it has a
fundamental system of open 0-neighbourhoods consisting of $\O_K$-submodules.
(Well let's just say this is a kind of good space so that we can talk about locally analytic functions, and normed spaces are locally convex).

Let $G$ be a $L$-analytic group, $V$ be a locally convex Hausdorff vector space over $K$.
We let $C^{\an}(G, V)$ be the set of locally analytic maps $G\to V$.
For a representation $\rho : G\to\GL(V)$,
we say that $v\in V$ is a \textbf{locally analytic vector},
if \[g\mapsto\rho(g)v : G\to V\]
is locally analytic.
