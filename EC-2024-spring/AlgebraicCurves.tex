\section{Algebraic Curves}
Let $K$ be a perfect field, $\bar{K}$ a fixed algebraic closure of $K$, and $G_K := \gal(\bar{K}/K)$ the absolute Galois group.
I think there are two main additional features of algebraic curves compared to Riemann surfaces:\begin{itemize}
    \item the Galois group $G_K$ acts on a variety (and many objects relevant to it) over $K$, and
    \item there are inseparable extensions in the positive characteristics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Affine and Projective Vartieties over $\bar{K}$}

Let $\bar{K}[\boldsymbol{X}] := \bar{K}[X_1, \dots, X_n]$ or $\bar{K}[X_0, X_1, \dots, X_n]$, $\A^n := \A^n(\bar K)$, and $\P^n:=\P^n(\bar{K})$.

\subsubsection{Vartieties and Local Rings}
An affine variety $V$ is defined as an irreducible algebraic set in $\A^n$; that is, $I(V)\subset \bar{K}[\boldsymbol{X}]$ is a prime ideal.
The affine coordinate ring and the function field of $V$ is \[\bar{K}[V] := \bar{K}[\boldsymbol{X}]/I(V) \myand \bar{K}(V) := \Frac \bar{K}[V].\]
For a point $P\in V$, we define the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_P$ at $P$ to be the ideal of regular functions vanishing at $P$, i.e.,\[\mathfrak{m}_P := \{f\in \bar{K}[V] : f(P) = 0\};\]
and the local ring $\bar{K}[V]_P$ at $P$ to be the localisation of $\bar{K}[V]$ at $\mathfrak{m}_P$.
So we have a chain of function sets \[\mathfrak{m}_P \subset \bar{K}[V] \subset \bar{K}[V]_P \subset \bar{K}(V), \]
and elements in $\bar{K}[V]_P$ are called regular functions at $P$.

The dimension of $V$ is the transcendence degree of $\bar{K}(V)$ over $\bar{K}$. 
Let $P\in V$ and $I(V) = (f_1, \dots, f_m)$. The variety $V$ is said to be nonsingular or smooth at $P$, if the Jacobian matrix \[J_V(P) := \left( \pdfrac{f_i}{X_j}(P) \right)_{\substack{1\le i\le m \\ 1\le j\le n}}\] has rank $n - \dim V$, which is equivalent to \[\dim_{\bar{K}}\mathfrak{m}_P/\mathfrak{m}_P^2 = \dim V.\]
For examples, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\dim\A^n = n$, and
    \item $\dim V = n - 1 \iff I(V) = (f)$ for some $f\in \bar{K}[\boldsymbol{X}]$, and $V$ is singular iff \[\pdfrac{f}{X_1} = \dots = \pdfrac{f}{X_n} = 0.\]
\end{itemize}

Now we turn to projective varieties. A projective variety $V$ is a projective algebraic set $V\subset\P^n$ s.t. the homogeneous ideal \[I_+(V) = (f\in K[\boldsymbol{X}] : f\text{ is homogeneous and }f(V) = \{0\})\subset K[X_0, \dots, X_n]\] is prime. The field of rational functions is \[\bar{K}(V) := \left\{ \frac{f}{g} : f, g\in \bar{K}[\boldsymbol{X}]\big/I_+(V)\text{ are homogeneous of the same degree}, g\ne 0 \right\}\]

Let us fix an immersion $\A^n\inject \P^n$, say $\A^n = \{X_0\ne 0\}\subset\P^n$. We have two opposite processes.
\begin{itemize}
    \item For a projective $V\subset \P^n$, $V\cap \A^n$ is an affine variety with ideal \[I(V\cap \A^n) = \big(f(1, X_1, \dots, X_n) : f(X_0, X_1,\dots, X_n)\in I_+(V)\big)\] 
    \item For an affine $V\subset \A^n$, the projective closure $\bar{V}$ has ideal $I_+(\bar{V})$ generated by the homogenisation of $I(V)$ w.r.t. $X_0$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{proposition}
    Let $V\subset\P^n$ be a projective variety.\begin{enumerate}
        \item The affine variety $V\cap \A^n$ is either empty or projective closure equal to $V$. In the latter case, $\bar{K}(V\cap \A^n)\simeq \bar{K}(V)$.
        \item For different choices of $\A^n\inject \P^n$ containing $P\in V$, $\bar{K}[V\cap \A^n]_P$'s are canonically isomorphic as local rings.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
Therefore, for $P\in V\subset\P^n$, we define $\mathfrak{m}_P$ and $\bar{K}[V]_P$ to be the corresponding local objects of $V\cap \A^n$, and the functions in $\bar{K}[V]_P$ are regualr functions at $P$.
